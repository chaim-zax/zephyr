  Worldsemi WS2812 LED strip, GPIO binding

  Driver bindings for bit-banging a WS2812 or compatible LED strip.

  The GPIO driver uses inline assembly, and isn't available for all
  boards. The timing is automatically derived from the cpu clock frequency,
  or can be manually provided by the Kconfig settings DELAY_Txx.

  / {
        cpus {
            cpu@0 {
                clock-frequency = <16000000>;
            };
        };
  };

compatible: "worldsemi,ws2812-gpio"

include: [base.yaml, ws2812-gpio.yaml]
